## Mockup
Before starting the website in github, the website was first mocked up in Wireframes. This ensured that there was a structure to refer to, content could be edited and a structure mock up of the different media queries could be created. 
Below you will see the wireframe used to refer to when the website was being coded.
![Wireframe-design](assets/images/readme/NYB-Wireframe.png)

You will see that along the coding process, the basic layout and content has been used. Along the way, there were changes made.

### Removals
I removed and replaced the Seasons games section. As the purpose of the website was to encourage players of all skill levels were welcome to join the team, I decided to include a recourse in the format of a video. This video explained th rules of the game and I felt this was a stronger use of the space for the purpose of the website. 
Once the video was included in the website, it was moved to be placed under the "about" section. This way, the user is informed of the game and then has the option to learn more about the club. 

I also removed the Home button the in the navigation. As the website is one streamlined page, it was a waste of headers space. The logo directs to the top of the page. 

### Edits
The layout of the form is a litle different to the wireframe. 

In the footer of the website, i moved the reserved text to be placed underneath the social media links. This created a stronger story of the website.  An addiitonal social media link was also added.

### Additions
I added subheadings to all the sections to enhance user readability of the website and to create a stronger flow of the website.

### Colours
Adobe color was used to find a colour pallet that would work for the young sporty feel for the team. The sharp colours were chosed to represent the youth players and the sport focus. 
These colours (with the additional of white) were used throughout the website to create a consistance and creative look.

### Baseball Rules
The club is for all skill levels. It became apparent that there needed to be recourses available for new members who may need to understnad the rules for the first time, or for participating members to have a refresher. 
The video plays within the page at the users control. 
This is a very educational section of the website.

As this is a local team, it was important for the user to understand the location of where the team practices and plays matches. The google map has been embeded so the user can control the map internally to the website without having to search the location up on an external wesbite/app.

# Newmarket Youth Baseball

This website is designed to inform used base in and around the newmarket area of the Newmarket Youth Baseball team. The website is designed to inform users of the expectations of where to practice and play, explain kit requirements and fees, as well as inform the user of where practices take place. There is no skill elvel requied to join the team, so the website is designed to include all skill levels.

## Mockup
Before starting the website in github, the website was first mocked up in Wireframes. This ensured that there was a structure to refer to, content could be edited and a structure mock up of the different media queries could be created. 
Below you will see the wireframe used to refer to when the website was being coded.

You will see that along the coding process, the basic layout and content has been used. Along the way, there were changes made.

### Removals
I removed and replaced the Seasons games section. As the purpose of the website was to encourage players of all skill levels were welcome to join the team, I decided to include a recourse in the format of a video. This video explained th rules of the game and I felt this was a stronger use of the space for the purpose of the website. 
Once the video was included in the website, it was moved to be placed under the "about" section. This way, the user is informed of the game and then has the option to learn more about the club. 

I also removed the Home button the in the navigation. As the website is one streamlined page, it was a waste of headers space. The logo directs to the top of the page. 

### Edits
The layout of the form is a litle different to the wireframe. 

In the footer of the website, i moved the reserved text to be placed underneath the social media links. This created a stronger story of the website.  An addiitonal social media link was also added.

### Additions
I added subheadings to all the sections to enhance user readability of the website and to create a stronger flow of the website.
